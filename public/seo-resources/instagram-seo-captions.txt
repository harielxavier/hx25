**TEMPLATE 5: GETTING READY SHOTS**

Caption:
"The calm before the beautiful chaos 🥂

Some of my favorite photos happen during getting ready - the nervous excitement, the helping hands, the mom wiping away tears, the last moments as 'just you' before you become a married couple.

This is why I always recommend booking full-day coverage. These candid, intimate moments? Pure gold.

Bride tip: Choose a getting-ready location with LOTS of natural light. Floor-to-ceiling windows = dreamy photos!

**TEMPLATE 3: WHAT TO WEAR GUIDE**

Caption:
"'What should we wear for our engagement photos??' - Every couple, ever 😂

Real talk: What you wear can make or break your photos. But don't stress - I've got you!

✨ MY TOP 5 TIPS: ✨

1️⃣ Coordinate, don't match (different tones of same color family)
2️⃣ Avoid busy patterns & logos
3️⃣ Think layers (jackets, scarves add dimension)
4️⃣ Comfort > Fashion (you'll feel it if you're uncomfortable)
5️⃣ Bring outfit options (we can change halfway!)

P.S. [Couple] absolutely NAILED their outfits for this session. The earth tones with the fall leaves? *Chef's kiss*

**TEMPLATE 2: EQUIPMENT/TECHNICAL**

"Gear talk! The camera setup that captured every moment of [Couple]'s wedding 📸

Someone asked what equipment I use, so here's the breakdown:

📷 Cameras: [Your cameras]
🔍 Favorite lens: [Your go-to lens]
💡 Lighting: [Your flash setup]
💾 Backup: Always shoot with 2 card slots (safety first!)

But here's the truth: The gear doesn't make the photo - knowing HOW to use it does. 14 years of experience + top-tier equipment = photos you'll treasure forever.

"Wedding Timeline Tip: The 4pm ceremony is MAGIC ✨

Here's why I always recommend 4-4:30pm ceremony times (especially April-October):

🌅 Ceremony: Beautiful afternoon light
🍸 Cocktail hour: Hits during golden hour (BEST photos!)
💃 Reception: Sunset during dinner, dark for dancing
📸 Couple portraits: That dreamy golden glow

The photos literally prove it - swipe to see the difference! ➡️

Timing is EVERYTHING in wedding photography. When you book with me, we'll plan your entire timeline around the best light.

**TEMPLATE 2: FAQ ANSWER**

Caption:
"'How soon will we get our photos?' - THE most asked question! ⏰

Here's my complete timeline:

🎉 Full Gallery: 6-8 weeks (all edited, downloadable, shareable)
💍 Engagement Photos: 2-3 weeks
📖 Albums: 8-10 weeks after ordering

WHY does editing take this long?

Because I don't just slap a filter on and call it done! Every single photo gets:
✅ Color correction
✅ Exposure adjustments
✅ Skin tone perfecting
✅ Detail enhancement
✅ Artistic editing

Your wedding deserves photos that are worth the wait!
