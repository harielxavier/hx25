EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: DAY 3 FOLLOW-UP
==============================================

Subject: Did you see [specific favorite photo]? 📸

Hey [Couple Names]!

Just checking in - did you get a chance to check out your gallery yet? 

I wanted to make sure you saw [describe a specific great photo - "that incredible sunset shot on the terrace" or "your first dance with everyone circled around you"]. It's one of my favorites from your day!

Have you had a chance to show your family and friends? I always love hearing their reactions!

Quick question: On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you with your photos? I genuinely want to know so I can keep improving.

If you're loving them (and I hope you are!), would you mind sharing a quick review on Google? It takes just 2 minutes and makes a HUGE difference for our small business.

[DIRECT GOOGLE REVIEW LINK - Make this a big, obvious button]

Thank you so much!

Mauricio

P.S. If anything isn't quite right, please let me know ASAP. I want you to be 100% thrilled!

EMAIL TEMPLATE 3: DAY 7 PRIMARY REQUEST
==============================================

Subject: Quick Favor? (takes 2 minutes!) ⭐

Hi [Couple Names],

Hope you're settling into married life! How's it feel?? 😊

I have a quick favor to ask. As a small, family-owned photography business, online reviews are literally how most couples find us. They're like gold for us!

If you're happy with your wedding photos (and I really hope you are!), would you be willing to leave us a Google review?

It takes just 2 minutes, and here's exactly how:

1. Click this link: [DIRECT GOOGLE REVIEW LINK]
2. Click the stars (hopefully 5! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
3. Write a sentence or two about your experience
4. Hit submit!

That's it! Super simple.

**What to mention (if you want ideas):**
- What you loved about working with us
- Your favorite photos/moments
- Would you recommend us to other couples?
- Anything about the Picatinny Club wedding (if applicable)

Your honest feedback helps us improve and helps other couples feel confident choosing us for their big day.

Thank you SO much! Seriously, you have no idea how much this helps our business.

If you have any questions or need anything, I'm always here!

Gratefully yours,
Mauricio Fernandez
Hariel Xavier Photography

PHONE CALL SCRIPT: DAY 21
==============================================

"Hi [Name], this is Mauricio from Hariel Xavier Photography! How are you?"

[Wait for response]

"I just wanted to check in personally - did you get a chance to check out all your wedding photos in the gallery?"

[If YES - positive response:]
"That's wonderful! I'm so glad you're happy with them. I have a quick question - I sent over a review request email a couple weeks ago. Did you happen to see that?"

[If they haven't left review:]
"No worries at all! I know you're busy settling into married life. Would you be open to leaving a quick Google review? I can text you the link right now if that's easier?"

[If they agree:]
"Amazing, thank you so much! I'm texting it to you right now. Just tap the link, click the stars, and write a quick sentence about your experience. Takes 2 minutes!"

[If they seem hesitant:]
"Is there anything about the photos or experience that wasn't quite right? I really want to know if there's something we could have done better."

[If there's an issue:]
"I really appreciate you telling me. Let me [address the issue]. And if we can resolve this, would you feel comfortable leaving a review after?"

[Closing:]
"Thanks so much for your time! Enjoy those photos and congrats again on the wedding!"


==============================================
EMAIL TEMPLATE 4: DAY 30 FINAL REQUEST
==============================================

Subject: Last request! (+ a thank you gift) 🎁

Hi [Couple Names],

This is my last email about reviews, I promise! 

I know I've asked a few times, and I totally get it - you're busy, life gets crazy, and leaving reviews probably isn't high on your priority list.

But here's the thing: Reviews literally make or break small businesses like ours. When a couple is choosing between photographers, those Google reviews are often the deciding factor.

So I'm going to sweeten the deal a bit: 

**If you leave us a Google review this week, I'll send you:**
- One free 8x10 print of your favorite photo
- OR 10% off if you decide to order an album later
- OR a free mini session next year for anniversary photos

I know it might feel like "just another review," but to us, it means the potential to book our next wedding and keep doing what we love.

Here's the link one more time: [DIRECT GOOGLE REVIEW LINK]

Either way, thank you for trusting us with your wedding photos. It was truly an honor.

All my best,
Mauricio

P.S. If you've already left a review and I somehow missed it, I apologize! And thank you! Let me know which thank you gift you'd like! 😊


==============================================
ALTERNATIVE: IN-PERSON REVIEW REQUEST
==============================================

**At Album Delivery Meeting:**

"Before you go, I have one quick favor. Would you be willing to leave us a Google review? You can do it right now on your phone if you have a second."

[Pull up Google review page on YOUR tablet/phone and hand it to them]

"Here, I can pull it up for you. Just tap the stars and write whatever comes to mind!"

**Success Rate:** 80%+ when asked in person!


==============================================
REVIEW INCENTIVE IDEAS (Use Carefully)
==============================================

Google's Guidelines: You CAN offer incentives, but you must:
1. Not require positive reviews
2. Make incentive available regardless of review content
3. Not pay cash for reviews

SAFE INCENTIVES:
✅ Free 8x10 print
✅ 10% off future services
✅ Free mini session
✅ Referral credit ($100 off for both parties)
✅ Early access to new packages
✅ Free album upgrade

UNSAFE INCENTIVES:
❌ Cash payments
❌ Gift cards
❌ Only for 5-star reviews
❌ "Pay for review" schemes


==============================================
HANDLING NEGATIVE REVIEWS
==============================================

IF you get a negative review (hopefully never!):

STEP 1: Don't Panic
- Take 24 hours before responding
- Don't respond emotionally

STEP 2: Reach Out Privately First
- Call or email the client
- Ask what went wrong
- Offer to make it right

STEP 3: Public Response (After Private Resolution)
"Hi [Name], thank you for your feedback. I'm sorry we didn't meet your expectations. I've reached out to you privately to discuss how we can make this right. Client satisfaction is our top priority."

STEP 4: Request Removal or Update
- If you resolve the issue, politely ask if they'd update/remove review
- Google allows review removal if: fake, spam, conflict of interest, or sexually explicit content

STEP 5: Bury It With Positive Reviews
- Double down on review requests from happy clients
- New positive reviews will push negative one down
